# Friday Night Funkin' Mod Porter (fnf porter)

Ports FNF mods between engines using Python. Right now, there's only support for Psych Engine to the Base Game, but new modes are coming soon! It has a GUI, cross-platform support, and logs (check the logs folder).


## Issues?
Report it in the [issues tab](https://github.com/gusborg88/fnf-porter/issues/new?body=Log+file+output+(check+logs+folder):%0A``)

Check if it already exists before reporting though!

Also, logs are printed to your log folder, so make sure to read that.
