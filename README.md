# Friday Night Funkin' Mod Porter

Ports FNF mods between engines using Python. Right now, there's only support for Psych Engine to the Base Game, but new modes are coming soon! It has a GUI, cross-platform support, and logs (check the logs folder).

## Download
Go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/gusborg88/fnf-porter/releases) for slightly older versions. You can compile it yourself 

## Issues?
Report it in the [issues tab](https://github.com/gusborg88/fnf-porter/issues/new?body=Log+file+output+(check+logs+folder):%0A``).

Check if it **already exists** before reporting though!

Also, logs are saved to your logs folder, so make sure to read them.

## Contributing
Thanks for contributing! You'll need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) ofc, and the other  dependencies listed in the next section. You can build after this by running [build.bat](build.bat). If you have questions about the code, ask Gusborg, tposejank, or BombasticTom.

## Dependencies
You can simply run dependencies.bat to install all of these at once. You have to go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and get Python first, though.
