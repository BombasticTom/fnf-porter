# Friday Night Funkin' Mod Porter (fnf porter)
Ports FNF mods between engines using python. Right now it's a CLI, but a GUI is coming in the future! 

### Psych to Base Game
The following files or folders are ported to Base Game accordingly:

* `pack.json`
* `pack.png`
* `data`
  * (all songs)
  * `credits.txt`
* `images`
  * `characters`
  * `icons`
  * `storymenu`
  * `menucharacters`
* `characters`
* `weeks`
* `stages`
* `songs`

### Psych to Codename
**On pause, will resume later**
