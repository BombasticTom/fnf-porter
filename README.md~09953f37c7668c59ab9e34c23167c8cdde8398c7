# Friday Night Funkin Port Tool (fnf porter)
Ports FNF mods between engines using the command prompt. For now its a windows tool but maybe linux mac support in the future
## Using arguments to skip dialog
First should go the directory of psych-2-codename.bat, then the directory of Psych mod folder, then the Codename mod folder, then the mod name, then the direction. 0 is Psych to Codename, 1 is Codename to Psych. Make sure to **erase all quotes**, and that the mod name has **no spaces**.

For example, if I wanted to copy kero from Psych to Codename on my computer, I could type this into the command prompt:

`C:\Users\Gus\Downloads\fnf-porter\psych-2-codename.bat C:\Users\Gus\SavedGames\PsychEngine\mods C:\Users\Gus\SavedGames\CodenameEngine\mods kero 0`
